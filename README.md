# Student Performance Prediction

## 📌 Overview
This project predicts a student's **math score** based on their **reading** and **writing scores** using Machine Learning.

## Problem Statement
Educational institutions want to analyze student performance to identify areas of improvement.  
This project uses a regression model to predict academic performance.

##  Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Google Colab  

##  Machine Learning Model
- Linear Regression

## Features Used
- Reading Score  
- Writing Score  

##  Workflow
1. Load and analyze dataset using Pandas  
2. Clean and preprocess data  
3. Split data into training and testing sets  
4. Train Linear Regression model  
5. Predict student performance  
6. Evaluate model using R² score  

## Sample Prediction
Input:
- Reading Score: 70  
- Writing Score: 75  

Output:
- Predicted Math Score (approximate)

##  Model Limitation
The model accuracy is limited due to fewer numerical features in the dataset.  
Including additional features like attendance and study hours can improve performance.
